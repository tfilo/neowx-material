## Installation

See the [official documentation](https://neoground.com/docs/neowx-material/index) for more information.

1. [Download](https://neoground.com/projects/neowx-material) the latest version
2. Install the extension: `wee_extension --install=path/to/neowx-material.zip`
3. restart weewx: `sudo service weewx restart`

If your skin doesn't change edit the `weewx.conf` and set `skin = neowx-material`
in the `[StdReport]` section, after that reload weewx: `sudo service weewx reload`.

This skin works best with the python ephem module installed 
(needed for the almanac). Install `pyephem` via pip, or the 
`python3-ephem` package via package manager.

## Contribution

Feel free to add your own improvements. Contributions are always welcome!

Our previous skin, NeoWX, was used all over the world in many countries.
We hope that this skin will do the same. Please consider translating our skin
in your language.

If you want to provide any improvements, feel free to create a pull request.
We use [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) commit messages.

## Development

Setting up the development environment is easy:

- clone / download repository
- install npm packages (`yarn install` / `npm install`)
- for easy testing create a symlink from your `WEEWX_HOME/skins/neowx-material`
  to the `src` directory
  
For basic tasks npm / yarn scripts are available.

Styling is done via SCSS, compile it to `css/style.css` by: `yarn run build-css`.

### Available scripts

| Script           | Description                                                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| build-css        | Create css/style.css from SCSS files                                  |
| build-minify-css | Create minified css/style.min.css from SCSS files                     |
| cleanup-build    | Remove development files from dist directory                          |
| copy-directories | Copy directories from src to dist (for building)                      |
| copy-files       | Copy files from src to dist (for building)                            |
| delete-build     | Remove files inside dist/skins/neowx-material                         |
| build            | Build job: delete-build, build-minify-css, copy files + dirs, cleanup |
| create-zip       | Creates a zip file of the dist directory. Use this after `build`      |

### Building

To create a dist package run `yarn run build`. This will clean up the dist environment
and copy all files, directories and create the minified CSS.

You find the final skin at `dist/skins/neowx-material`. 
Create a zip-file of the `dist` directory to create the final package
which you can easily install with `wee_extension`.

You may need to adjust the values if you add / change file names. In this case you
may also need to adjust the dist/install.py script which contains a list of all
files which should be copied to the weewx skin directory on installation.

Building is currently only supported on linux systems due to system commands used
in the npm scripts. On other systems this needs to be adjusted or done manually.

## Thank You!

This config and some parts of the skin are based on the template code      
of the original "Standard" skin of weewx. Many thanks to Tom Keffer and     
the weewx contributors. 
One of the best solutions for your weather station under linux!

The design is based on 
[Material Design for Bootstrap (MDB) Free](https://mdbootstrap.com).

The NOAA reports, and some parts of the configuration 
are based on the Standard weewx skin as well.
